## Aim

  Our overall goal was to delve into the creation of complex Software Defined Network (SDN) topologies - through the use of the Ryu SDN Framework, Mininet and VirtualBox Virtual Machines (VMs) - and the collection of flow statistics through Ryu's inbuilt Application Programming Interface (API) - `ofctl_rest`. Through this, we simulated various attack and normal traffic flows within our emulated network to make a dataset, which was used to train and compare Machine Learning (ML) models for an ML-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
  
  In short: **To strengthen security in SDNs by creating a dataset and comparing ML models for an ML-based IDS present within the controller.**

### Collected Dataset

A total of roughly 291k attack flows (spread over 11 classes) and 122k normal flows (spread over 5 classes) were collected as CSV files through the `ofctl_rest` API. This was done by pinging the API endpoints every second while the respective type of flow was being generated.

Laplacian correction (adding 1 to all values) was applied before division transformation to handle division by zero.

To address the limitations of individual feature selection methods, three methods were employed and the intersection of their results was used to identify key variables. The three methods applied were:

- **FDR**<sup>[[3]](#references)</sup>: controls for the expected proportion of false rejection of features in multiple significance testing
- **Stepwise Selection**<sup>[[8]](#references)</sup>: an iterative process of adding important features to a null set of features and removing the worst performing features
- **Boruta**<sup>[[6]](#references)</sup>: iteratively removes features that are relatively less statistically significant compared to random probability distribution

The 13 transformed features, as well as the final 5 selected by the above feature selection methods' intersection (bolded) is given below:

RobustScaler<sup>[[9]](#references)</sup> (RS) was then applied to handle outliers in the dataset, ensuring that the model is not overly affected by extreme values.

### Model Training & Analysis

We selected an ML model by performing a comprehensive comparison between 6 unique models using multiple evaluation metrics **before performing dimensionality reduction** on the dataset. The models compared were:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: a simple, instance-based learning algorithm;
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: a powerful classifier that works by finding the optimal hyperplane for separation;
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**: a probabilistic model used for binary classification
- **Decision Tree (DT)**: a model that splits data into homogenous subsets based on feature values;
- **Naive Bayes (NB)**: a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions;
- **Random Forest (RF)**: an ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy by averaging multiple models.

RF was chosen over DT as RF demonstrates improved robustness and generalization by combining multiple decision trees, reducing the risk of overfitting. RF achieves 100% accuracy across all attack classes, making it highly reliable for our IDS.

The PCA, LDA and ICA dimensionality reduction techniques were then compared using the RF model.

</details>

The performance with LDA, the best of all three, was slightly lower than using the dataset without dimensionality reduction. Given that this performance difference is negligible, we opted to use LDA for dimensionality reduction, as it allows us to reduce the feature space from 5 to 4 features.

The final RF model pipeline, with manual division transformation, feature selection through intersection, scaling and dimensionality reduction, gave a final performance of 99.99% across all metrics, with marginal variance.

To achieve similar results without an extensive pre-processing pipeline, the Feed Forward Neural Network DL model was evaluated. Running the model directly on the dataset's transformed features achieved an accuracy of ~98.7%, with other metrics in a similar range. Performance dropped significantly when the dataset was reduced through feature selection and dimensionality reduction, suggesting that this approach is more suitable for larger datasets.

## Future Work

- Implementation of a _functional_ IDS and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

> [!NOTE]
> A legacy (partially working) IDS is provided in the [Ryu Controller subdirectory](/Dataset%20Collection/), It utilizes an RF model trained with an RS PCA preprocessing pipeline. Predictions are a hit or miss.

- Test out more DL models
