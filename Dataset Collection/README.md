# Dataset Collection

This folder details how to collect the dataset.

First, setup the [Ryu Controller](./Ryu%20Controller/) following the steps mentioned within the subfolder.

After this, start the controller and begin the process of generating either the [Attack Traffic](./Attack%20Traffic%20Generation/) or the [Normal Traffic](./Normal%20Traffic%20Generation/) to collect their respective flows.

Our dataset is available in the [Collected Dataset](./Collected%20Dataset/) subfolder.
